Let iOS apps talk

A directory of iOS apps that can be launched via URLs including ones that support x-callback-url.

## Motivation

While tinkering with the amazing [Workflow app](http://workflow.is) I discovered [x-callback-url](http://x-callback-url.com), a way to let apps to talk to each other through URLs with standardized callback parameters. This looked amazing.

I then wanted to find out which apps already supported this and found that the current app directories are outdated / not exhaustive. As it quite often happens documentation is not always up-to-date.

So I wanted to fix this. And the only way to have a chance to stay up-to-date is to crowd source the documentation. So this repository allows for exactly that.
